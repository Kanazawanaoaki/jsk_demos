Crack the eggs into a bowl just before cooking, and beat the eggs with rapeseed chopsticks by scraping the bottom of the bowl with your hands back and forth about 30 times.
Add milk, salt, and pepper.
Heat the salad oil in a small frying pan over medium heat for about 2 minutes and add the butter.
When about 2/3 of the butter has melted and is bubbling, pour in the egg mixture from a high point all at once. If you pour it in vigorously, it will cook more evenly, and the mixture will be fluffier and less likely to curdle.
Do not stir or shake the mixture immediately, but leave it in place for about 20 seconds.
When the edges and bottom begin to harden, stir quickly 30 to 40 times with a wooden spoon.
When the mixture becomes thick, turn off the heat and serve quickly. The mixture will harden in the residual heat, so remove when there are still some raw bits on the surface. Serve with toasted bread.
