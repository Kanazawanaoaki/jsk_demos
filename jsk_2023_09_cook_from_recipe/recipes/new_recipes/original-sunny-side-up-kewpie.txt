crack the eggs into a bowl in advance. If eggs are cracked directly into the frying pan, the yolks will be crushed and the shells will be mixed in.
Heat the frying pan over medium heat, and when hot, add the salad oil. Immediately after the salad oil is blended in, gently place the eggs in the pan from a low position.
Lower the heat to low and cook, uncovered, for 3 to 5 minutes until the yolks are the desired consistency. If you want the bottom of the whites to be crispy, increase the heat at the end.
When cooked, gently remove the yolks from the pan with a spatula and place in a dish with leaf lettuce and tomatoes cut into wedges.
